# Fulfillment Rate Analysis in a Beauty Supply Chain

## Overview
This project analyzes the fulfillment rate performance of a beauty supply chain company, with a current rate of **73.65%**, which is below industry benchmarks. The goal is to identify possible factors driving low fulfillment rates using available operational data.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Supply Chain Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis)
- **Key Features:** Order Quantities, Stock Levels, Availability (used as proxy for fulfillment), Lead Time, Shipping Time.

## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Looker Studio (Google Data Studio)

## Key Insights
- **No strong relationship** between fulfillment rate and lead time.
- **High stock levels don’t guarantee** high fulfillment — e.g., stock levels of 80 and 60 still showed low fulfillment rates (10.4% and low teens).
- **Shipping time** also shows no clear link to fulfillment.
- Correlation values between fulfillment rate and the tested factors are below **1%**.
- A likely driver could be **low warehouse or order processing utilization**, which could not be tested with the available dataset.
